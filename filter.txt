FILTER

	A low-pass filter is a filter that passes signals with a frequency lower than a selected cutoff frequency and attenuates signals with frequencies higher than the cutoff frequency
	C = 200-e6
	L = 150-e3

	Low-pass Filters(LPF)

	Low-pass filters are filter circuits that pass DC and low-frequency signals and cut high-frequency signals.
	They are the most widely used filter circuits and are mainly used to cut high-frequency noise.
	In audio, they are also used to cut treble/mid-range sound components of bass speakers.

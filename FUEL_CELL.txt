A fuel cell is a device that generates electricity by a chemical reaction

Every fuel cell has two electrodes called, respectively, the anode and cathode

The reactions that produce electricity take place at the electrodes.


Fuel cells work like batteries, but they do not run down or need recharging. They produce electricity and heat as long as fuel is supplied. A fuel cell consists of two electrodes—a negative electrode (or anode) and a positive electrode (or cathode)—sandwiched around an electrolyte.

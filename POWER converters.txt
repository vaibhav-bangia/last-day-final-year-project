POWER ELECTRONICS
	converting electrical power from once form to another.

POWER ELECTRONIC CONVERTERS
	
	WHY USE?
		produce the power that application needs.


	block diagram
		electrical energy source-> power electronic circuit--> electrical load

		electrical enegy source + PE ckt + control ckt + electrical load

		CONVERTER CHANGES ONE FORM OFO ENERGY TO ANOTHER

	POWER ELECTRONICS ----> 	
	conversion of power from one form to another and chagne from one voltage level to another.


POWER ELECTRONIC CONVERTERS -
	AC to DC  rectifier
	DC to ac  inverter dc to ac of req freq
	DC to DC  chopper -- constant to variable dc or variable dc to constant dc
	ac to ac cycloconverter 





ac to dc 
	ac from main lines to dc supply to load
	RECTIFIER 
		ac->transformer->rectifier(+CONTROL BLOCK)->filter->load

		step down transformer 
		rectifier -> low voltage ac supply to dc supply


		o/p of rectifier is pulsed dc and is filtered using filter circuit




		RECTIFIER CONVERTES LOW VOLTAGE AC SUPPLY INTO DC SUPPLY
		
		CLASSIFICATION OF RECTIFIERS 	
			Uncontrolled Diode Rectifiers.
			Controlled Rectifierss.

				UNCONTROLLED
					ac voltage from mains --> fixed line DC

					types 
						single phase half wave rect
						single phase centre tapped full wave rect
						single phase full wave bridge
						single phase full wavae bridge
						3 phase half wave
						3 phase full wave bridege
				PHASE CONTROLLED RECTIFIER
					DIFF B/W UNCONTROLLED VS PHASE CONTROLLED
						UNCONTROLLED DIODES REPLACED BY CONTROLLED THYRISTOR FAMILY OF DEVICEIS SUCH AS SCRs. (Silicon controlled rectifier)

					Unlike diodes, thyristors can be controlled by triggering them at desired instants in order to vary the output voltage.


					CONTROLLED RECTIFIER BLOCK DIAGRAM
						AC SUPPLY->CONTROLED RECTIFER(CONTROL CKT)-> LOAD

						TRANSFERS DC POWER TO THE LOAD IN CONTGROL MANNER BY VARYING TRIGGERING ANGLE OF THYRISTORS ( BY CONTROL CKT)


dc to dc 
	Many DC operated applications need different levels of DC voltage from a fixed DC source.

	Some of these applications include subway cars, DC traction systems, control of large DC motors, battery operated vehicles, trolley buses, etc. They require variable DC to produce variable speed, so a power conversion device is needed.

	A DC chopper is a static device that converts a fixed input DC voltage to variable DC output or a fixed DC output of different magnitude (which can be lower or higher) than input value. The block diagram of a DC chopper is shown in figure below.

	chopper ckt is connected b/w dc i/p source and dc load

	o/p of chopper can be less or greater than the i/p and it can also be fixed or variable


	DC choppers are mainly used in DC drives, i.e., electric vehicles and hybrid electric vehicles.

	DC choppers are classified into three basic types based on input and output voltage levels and are discussed below.


		STEP DOWN CHOPPER/BUCK
		STEP UP CHOOPPPER//BOOOOOOOOOST CONVERTER
		BUCK BOOST CONVERTER
